            <p class="book-description-text">
                "Childhood" is a novel by Leo Tolstoy that was published in 1852 
                in a semi-autobiographical trilogy that includes "Childhood," 
                "Boyhood," and "Youth," which are often referred to collectively 
                as "The Childhood Trilogy". It tells the story of a young boy named 
                Nikolai Irtenev, who is the main protagonist of the novel. 
                The story is set in the 19th century in rural Russia and is 
                narrated from Nikolai's perspective as he reflects on his early 
                years. <br><br>

                The novel "Childhood" vividly portrays the world as seen through 
                the eyes of a child. Tolstoy artfully captures the innocent and 
                impressionable mind of a young boy, depicting his observations, 
                experiences, and emotions in a poetic and introspective manner. 
                Nikolai's childhood is marked by a sense of wonder, curiosity, 
                and imagination, as he navigates the complexities of family, 
                relationships, and society. <br><br>

                Throughout the novel, Tolstoy delves into the inner world of 
                Nikolai, revealing his thoughts, dreams, and aspirations. 
                He depicts Nikolai's relationships with his family, including 
                his loving but troubled mother, his strict and distant father, 
                and his beloved aunt. Tolstoy also portrays Nikolai's interactions 
                with other children, his first experiences of friendship, 
                and his encounters with the social norms and expectations of 
                his time. <br><br>

                As Nikolai grows older, he begins to grapple with questions of 
                morality, faith, and the meaning of life. He confronts challenges, 
                confrontations, and losses that shape his worldview and 
                lead him to question the established norms and beliefs of his society. 
                "Childhood" is a poignant exploration of the formative years of a 
                young boy's life, capturing the joys, sorrows, and complexities 
                of growing up and coming to terms with the realities of the world. <br><br>

                Tolstoy's "Childhood" is often praised for its lyrical prose, 
                vivid imagery, and psychological insights into the inner world 
                of a child. It is considered a classic of Russian literature and 
                is regarded as one of Tolstoy's early masterpieces, showcasing 
                his literary talent and his ability to capture the human condition 
                with profound depth and sensitivity.
