            <p class="book-description-text">
                "Giong to" is a tragedy depicting the lowliness 
                and lack of integrity of human beings in all 
                aspects of life: no one can trust anyone, 
                no one can rely on anyone. From within to outside, 
                from siblings to parents, from wives to husbands, 
                from fathers to children, all live in deceit, selfishness, 
                a closed loop of incest: crime and deception are rampant 
                everywhere, and the consequences are unpredictable. <br><br>

                "Giong to" is not a novel like "Tat den" by Ngo Tat To or 
                "Doan tuyet" by Nhat Linh. It is not just about exposing 
                the corruption in the feudal village system, the exploitation
                of the rich and officials in the countryside during the French 
                colonial period, like Ngo Tat To. It does not dismantle 
                the traditional family system of the early 20th century 
                society, like Nhat Linh.<br><br>

                Vu Trong Phung portrays human beings in the most realistic 
                way in all times: the constant change of heart of human 
                beings in a society where money can dominate everything.<br><br>

                While other authors only depict the victims of the system, 
                such as Loan in "Doan tuyet," the victim of the mother-in-law 
                and daughter-in-law system; Dau in "Tat den," the victim of 
                heavy taxes and corrupt officials; Binh in "Bi vo," 
                the victim of betrayal by a lover, the cruelty of parents, 
                and the harshness of society, etc.<br><br>

                The characters in Vu Trong Phung's works are 
                different: in "Giong to," we cannot find any faces 
                that are overly sympathetic or overly detestable,
                even Nghi Hach and Thi Mich, who are two contrasting 
                characters, the rapist and the victim.<br><br>

                In "Giong to" (as well as in "Vo de" and "So do"), 
                there is no clear division between victims and perpetrators, 
                so critics like Truong Chinh, who are accustomed to dividing 
                things into good and bad, cannot understand the complexity of 
                Thi Mich's character.
