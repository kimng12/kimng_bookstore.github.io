                "Youth" is a short novel by Leo Tolstoy, 
                first published in 1856. It tells the story of Dmitry Ivanovich, 
                a young man from a wealthy family who embarks on a journey of 
                self-discovery after experiencing disillusionment with his privileged 
                lifestyle. The novel explores themes of youth, idealism, love, 
                and the search for meaning in life. <br><br>

                As Dmitry travels through Russia, he encounters 
                a variety of people and experiences that challenge 
                his assumptions about the world. He falls in love with 
                a young woman named Masha, but his idealistic visions 
                of their future together are shattered when he realizes 
                she does not share his beliefs.<br><br>
                
                Throughout the novel, Dmitry struggles to reconcile 
                his desire for a meaningful life with the reality of 
                his privileged upbringing. He comes to see that his wealth 
                and status have shielded him from the struggles and hardships 
                of ordinary people, and that true happiness can only be found 
                through empathy and connection with others.<br><br>
                
                "Youth" is considered one of Tolstoy's early masterpieces, 
                and is praised for its psychological depth and vivid portrayal 
                of Russian society in the mid-19th century.
