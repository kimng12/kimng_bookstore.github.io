            <p class="book-description-text">
                In 1930, Nguyen Tuan was arrested and imprisoned 
                for illegally traveling to Thailand without a permit. 
                After serving his sentence, he returned to work as a secretary 
                for a gas and electricity company. <br><br>

                Despite holding a high position in the company, 
                Nguyen Tuan did not have a permanent residence. 
                His actual home was a small room in a theater. 
                It was there that he met Thong Phu, a man nearly twenty years his senior.<br><br>

                At that time, Thong Phu was a notorious playboy. 
                He did not mind when Nguyen Tuan became his long-term guest, 
                and even read him poems he had written or tales he had made up 
                for his newfound young friend.<br><br>

                Nguyen Tuan and Thong Phu became close friends. 
                For Nguyen Tuan, Thong Phu had a mesmerizing way of reading. 
                The uniqueness lay not only in the poems he recited, whether 
                self-composed or from earlier poets, but also in the pronunciation 
                and the pauses, which he embellished with his own style.<br><br>

                Thong Phu, who was known for his charismatic personality, 
                had spent half his life using that charming mouth of his to 
                recite his own poetry, as well as folktales and anecdotes that 
                no one else could imitate. If only he had lived during the Warring 
                States period, his eloquence would have surely won over many admirers.<br><br>

                However, peace did not last long as tragedy struck when Thong Phu fell ill. 
                He was no longer as healthy as before, suffering not only from speech 
                impairment but also partial paralysis. <br><br>

                Nguyen Tuan, not merely a writer in search of beauty, 
                wrote about the gritty reality of the rooms, the struggles 
                of a brothel owner, or the heavy breathing of an aging courtesan, 
                all vividly portrayed in his work "Chiếc lư đồng mắt cua" 
                (The Brass Binnacle). The inspiration for his success came 
                from a brass binnacle, a gift from Thong Phu to the writer. 
                It was not only an antique collectible for display but also a 
                trigger for memories, helping Nguyen Tuan awaken.<br><br>

                Nguyen Tuan knew that he could not live forever in the darkness, 
                surrounded by vices. He decided to start anew by moving to another place, 
                with Saigon as his destination.<br><br>

                He thought he had left behind his past of debauchery 
                and promiscuity in Thanh Hoa, but when he arrived in Vinh, 
                he met a girl named Phuong. At first, Nguyen Tuan did not 
                recognize her, as the memories of the past had faded from his mind.<br><br>

                The encounter with Phuong was unexpected, and she seemed to have a mysterious aura. 
                Nguyen Tuan's curiosity was piqued, and he began to feel a renewed sense of passion 
                and interest in life. The story of Nguyen Tuan's new journey was just beginning as 
                he embarked on a new chapter in his life in Saigon.
