            <p class="book-description-text">
                "Song Mon" is a novel written by Nam Cao in 1944, 
                initially titled "Chet Mon" ("Dying Slowly"). 
                It was first published in 1956 by Van Nghe Publishing House 
                and was later changed to its current title, "Song Mon". <br><br>

                The novel can be seen as an autobiographical account full of turmoil 
                and contemplation of the struggles of intellectual and inner 
                life of the poor in that time period.<br><br>
                
                Although the plot does not have many dramatic or complex details, 
                it still manages to convey a very subtle and profound message 
                that only Nam Cao could describe.<br><br>
                
                The story is about a young man named Thu, 
                who comes from a poor family but has education 
                and aspirations for the future. After finishing his studies, 
                he goes to the South to find a stable job, 
                but he returns home after three years due to the 
                difficulties of the time period before 1945.<br><br>
                
                While unemployed, Thu is offered a job as a teacher at a 
                private school by his cousin Dich, and he becomes a struggling teacher. 
                Despite his passion for teaching, low salary and 
                conflicts related to money make him feel frustrated 
                and stuck with his own life.<br><br>
                
                As an educated and kind-hearted person, 
                Thu is always ashamed and regretful of his difficult life. 
                In addition, the difficult circumstances of his family, 
                with his wife and children waiting for his meager income, 
                make him feel sad and distressed. 
                In a society that was still poor and struggling everywhere, 
                making a living was not easy, let alone pursuing one's own 
                dreams and ambitions.<br><br>
                
                Although the plot is simple and not complicated, 
                Nam Cao's writing portrays the psychological pain 
                of the characters very realistically, making the reader 
                easily empathize with them.<br><br>
                
                One of the most memorable quotes from the novel is: 
                "On those riverbanks, many people live like me, 
                but they never resist their lives. Their lives are 
                a life in captivity. But just like a buffalo, they 
                still lower their heads to plow, eat grass, and endure beatings. 
                On the other side of the muddy fields, 
                there is the land of happiness, the land that we can never reach."
